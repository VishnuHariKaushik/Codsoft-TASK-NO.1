1. Data Exploration and Loading:

Downloaded the Titanic dataset from Kaggle.
Explored the dataset to understand its structure and columns.
Loaded the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.

2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Handled missing values by dropping unnecessary columns and filling missing values with appropriate methods (e.g., mean for numerical columns, mode for categorical columns).
Performed categorical encoding to convert categorical variables into numerical representations.

3. Data Analysis and Visualization:

Analyzed the distribution of survival outcomes, gender, passenger classes, and other relevant features.
Visualized the data using count plots, bar charts, and other appropriate visualizations to gain insights.

4. Model Training and Evaluation:

Split the data into training and testing sets.
Trained a logistic regression model on the training set to predict survival.
Evaluated the model's performance using accuracy metrics on both training and testing sets.

5. Model Deployment (Optional):

Created a Flask app to provide a web interface for making predictions using the trained model.
Deployed the app using ngrok to make it accessible publicly.
